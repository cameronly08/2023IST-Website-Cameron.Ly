<h4> Kentucky Fried Chicken </h4>
<button> The Rise of KFC </button>
<img src=" https://www.primenewsghana.com/images/2019/may/KFC.jpg" />
<P> The rise of a fast food chain that depended solely on their chicken recipe.  Colonel Harland Sanders (1890-1980) created KFC after selling fried chicken from a roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. Sanders saw the potential of the restaurant franchising concept and created the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast-food sector, broadening the market by challenging the hamburger's existing supremacy. Harland became a major figure in American cultural history by branding himself as "Colonel Sanders," and his image is still widely used in KFC advertising to this day. The company's rapid expansion, however, overwhelmed the aging Sanders, and he sold it in 1964 to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey. </P>
